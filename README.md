## What this texture pack does

Rename things, and remove words

- Removed the word enchant, enchanted, enchanting, enchantment from the game. Enchanted golden apple is super golden apple
- Renamed potions to formulas
- Removed "Curse of" from upgrades so they are now just "binding upgrade" and "vanishing upgrade"
- Renamed hoglin to beeflin
- Changed the name of totem of undying to clutch 
- Removed the word "soul" from game (soul sand -> nether sand) (soul campfire -> blue campfire) e.t.c
- Renamed Unbreaking to Durability
- Renamed Fortune to Yeild
- Renamed zoglin to zeeflin
- Renamed pig and pork, to cow and beef, including the cooked variants
- Changed bad-omen name to enmity, trail omen to trail alert, and raid omen to raid alert
- Removed end dialogue
- Removed problematic splashes (I didn't do it on the base of a criteria, I just removed whichever one didn't feel ok to me as it's not really a big deal to remove one)

Retexture things

- Removed the floating letters around enchantment table (Once I saw them for a bit, maybe it was cause I disabled halal pack) 
- Changed the texture of totem of undying
- Retextured pig to cow
- Retextured porkchop to beef and cooked variants too
- Changed soul sand texture

## Disclaimer

When we were first making this texture pack, we didn't really have a proper source on what is haram and halal, so we changed many things that I doubt were haram (i.e potions, enchantments). The reason we kept the changes is because there are still many people who believe these things are haram, and there could be difference of opinion too.

If you want to know what is haram or halal in games than I would recommend this [Q&A session from garden of ilm, sheikh is Sheikh Abdul Aziz al Haqqan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM07ylnYIfg) and [it's part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgjm0xGmSS8)
