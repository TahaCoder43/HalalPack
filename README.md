# Things to do 

- Add something halal to the ending dialogue (for now it's removed)
- remove souls that come out of sould sand, and also sculk
- remove problematic splash screen texts
- make the wither halal (or maybe it already is)
- remove the bell somehow (I am in doubt regarding this one, perhaps we could just remove the sound)
- replace pig sounds
- rename music disk to nasheed disk
- replace the music in music disks with nasheeds

## How to do (some of these things)?

As for the wither, rename soulsand -> radioactive sand. Thus it powers up the wither. But what about him coming to life????? Make lore that when you kill the wither skeleton, sometimes it dies but sometimes only it's head (wither skull) survives, and it can live with only it's head, thus wither skull are alive, they just don't have energy (cause we fought them, and destroyed them). So when they are connected with radioactive sand they get energy, but since it's three skulls (and radioactive sand gives lots of energy), they fuse to make one powerful being. This would also solve the soul speed problem as we can renamed it to radioactive speed

# Question

- Do we rename brewing stand and witch (I personally disagree here)
- Do we remove potion bubly effect
- Do we have to remove the letters and the floating book

# Things done

## Renaming

- Renamed hoglin to beeflin
- Removed the word enchant, enchanted, enchanting, enchantment from the game. Enchanted golden apple is super golden apple
- Renamed potions to formulas
- Removed "Curse of" from upgrades so they are now just "binding upgrade" and "vanishing upgrade"
- Changed the name of totem of undying to clutch 
- Removed the word "soul" from game (soul sand -> nether sand) (soul campfire -> blue campfire) e.t.c
- Renamed Unbreaking to Durability
- Renamed Fortune to Yeild
- Renamed zoglin to zeeflin
- Renamed pig and pork, to cow and beef, including the cooked variants
- Changed bad-omen name to enmity, trail omen to trail alert, and raid omen to raid alert
- Removed end dialogue
- Removed problematic splashes (I didn't do it on the base of a criteria, I just removed whichever one didn't feel ok to me as it's not really a big deal to remove one)

## Retexturing

- Removed the floating letters around enchantment table (Once I saw them for a bit, maybe it was cause I disabled halal pack) 
- Changed the texture of totem of undying
- Retextured pig to cow

### Retextured but not observed

- Changed soul sand texture
- Change the warden's chest to remove the souls,
- Retextured porkchop to beef and cooked variants too

# Things I could not do

- Change Nbt data Enchantments (upgrades will still be stored as enchantments inside gamecode)
- change enchant command 
- Could not make the texture of the floating book invisible (it just turned into white floating book), I have a plan tho, we could maybe kill it with commands
- Could not remove code name for stuff with enchantment in there name

## Solutions?
I think the floating book's model can be changed maybe idk

I think we can create a mod, to solve the rest of these problems

so a texture pack for someone who is ok with these problems, but a mod, for someone who may use commands and nbt data, and needs to remove the word enchantment
