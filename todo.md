# Things to do 

- remove the bell somehow
- Change the warden's chest to remove the souls,
- make the wither halal ig
- Change soul sand texture
- Rename hoglin to beeflin
- retexture the pig to mini cow
- retexture pork to mini beef but healthy 

# How?

As for the warden, there is a seperate texture for itself, and blue parts of it which glow. I think you have to modify the glow parts to remove the souls(remember to check this)

As for the wither, rename soulsand -> radioactive sand. Thus it powers up the wither. But what about him coming to life????? Make lore that when you kill the wither skeleton, sometimes it dies but sometimes only it's head (wither skull) survives, and it can live with only it's head, thus wither skull are alive, they just don't have energy (cause we fought them, and destroyed them). So when they are connected with radioactive sand they get energy, but since it's three skulls (and radioactive sand gives lots of energy), they fuse to make one powerful being. This would also solve the soul speed problem as we can renamed it to radioactive speed

# Question

- Do we change bad-omen's name to revenge

- what do we do about this, do we change it
```
"advancements.nether.all_potions.title": "A Furious Cocktail",
```
- Do you guys think this is enough
```
"advancements.adventure.totem_of_undying.description": "Use a Clutch to clutch death",
```
- Do we rename brewing stand and witch (I personally disagree here)
- Do we remove potion bubly effect
- Do we have to remove the letters and the floating book
- Do we remove the texture of totem of undying (I think yes definetly it's an idol of a villager)

# Check what I did lol, it was prevoiusly "postmortal"

```
"advancements.adventure.totem_of_undying.title": "What a clutch!",
```

# Things done

- Removed the floating letters around enchantment table (Once I saw them for a bit, maybe it was cause I disabled halal pack) 
- Removed the word enchant, enchanted, enchanting, enchantment from the game. Enchanted golden apple is super golden apple
- Renamed potions to formulas
- Removed "Curse of" from upgrades so they are now just "binding upgrade" and "vanishing upgrade"
- Changed the name of totem of undying to clutch 
- Changed the texture of totem of undying
- Removed the word "soul" from game (soul sand -> nether sand) (soul campfire -> blue campfire) e.t.c
- Renamed Unbreaking to Durability
- Renamed Fortune to Yeild
- Changed bad-omen name to enmity, trail omen to trail alert, and raid omen to raid alert

# Things I could not do

- Change Nbt data Enchantments (upgrades will still be stored as enchantments inside gamecode)
- change enchant command 
- Could not make the texture of the floating book invisible (it just turned into white floating book), I have a plan tho, we could maybe kill it with commands
- Could not remove code name for stuff with enchantment in there name

## Solutions?
I think the floating book's model can be changed maybe idk

I think we can create a mod, to solve the rest of these problems

so a texture pack for someone who is ok with these problems, but a mod, for someone who may use commands and nbt data, and needs to remove the word enchantment

## Things to do with command

change cooked porkchop to cooked beef
